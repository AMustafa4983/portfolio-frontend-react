        "<span class="text-yellow-200">Back in secondary school,</span> I discovered my love for content creation.
        <br/>
        Video editing and voice overs were my first endeavors, <span class="text-yellow-200">driven by the desire to craft my own narratives.</span> However, I soon realized it wasn't my true passion. 

        A pivot led me to the realm of machine learning engineering. This new world <span class="text-yellow-200">ðŸŒŸ sparked something special within me.</span> I immersed myself in books, courses, and college studies, honing my skills in machine learning and software engineering. 

        As I delved deeper into the data analysis life cycle, I felt a shift. I questioned the need to master every aspect solely for a job. With a foundation in video editing, I returned to my roots, this time exploring motion graphics and graphic design with Adobe's suite of tools. 

        The experience was captivating, leading to a phase of freelancing. Yet, I yearned for more. It was clear that this, too, wasn't my ultimate calling. Thus, I circled back to machine learning and software engineering. 

        Determined to expand my knowledge, I embarked on a project-filled journey. Collaboration with esteemed labs like FARIL-MGH, James Brasic Lab at Johns Hopkins, and Dr. Shuhan He at Conduct Science and MGH allowed me to craft professional solutions. 

        Creating my portfolio website presented a new challenge. Despite prior experience with web development, web design was a fresh territory. Why stop at models? Learning React, I crafted the website you see now. 

        On the horizon, I'm gearing up to share my experiences through a YouTube channel and Medium blog. The story doesn't end here. In the midst of it all, I nurture my love for music, learning to play the guitar ðŸŽ¸ and cherishing my role as a singer ðŸŽ¤. 

        In the end, I've come to realize that I'm a multi-passionate individual. Each venture, each hobby, holds a special place in my heart. The journey continues, and I can't wait to see where it takes me next. ðŸŒŸðŸŽ¶"
